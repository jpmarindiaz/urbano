# Datasketch Urbano

This book is an open operating manual to create urban visualizations. 

We believe in an open society were actions and tools to improve democratization of knowledge will lead to a more tolerant and understanding society were different views not only live together but are encouraged to be put face to face, so we, as humans, can make better informed decisions.

Data plays a key role in the quest to democratize access to knowlegde. We want to push data's role closer to our daily lives by providing a new communication channel for humans to interact with data. 

The approach explored in this books aims at connecting science and art into a mix we call Urban Visualization. It is not about visualizing urban data, but rather visualizing data in urban space.

The initial proposed urban visualization mechanisms emerge from our goal to democratize access to data and visualization. It is an effort to bring more tools to citizens so we make better informed decisions. 

Art and science make a beautiful mix to touch our hearts and brains. 

When we have human experiences and stories on the one side, and numbers and averages on the other

We aim at making data more human.

Moving beyond our digital experiences with data can make numbers more human. 

This is a live book. We will be be adding and updating resources as we experiment with different visualization types, materials and our experience with cities and open space.

New means for communication, where facts and concepts can be expressed together.

Urban visualizations can create a bridge between art and science, facts and beliefs.




Let's explore how we can merge together these worlds.
